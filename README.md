Visualizing data for streamers on Twitch

# Context
This data was from a Kaggle dataset 
https://www.kaggle.com/aayushmishra1512/twitchdata

# Process
With this dataset, I cleaned and visualized the data and commented my process throughout. 
As I occasionally watch Twitch livestreams, I wanted to analyze the data and see if some of the streamers I watch were included in this dataset and see how they compared to some of their counterparts.
